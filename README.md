# QuackQuackHonk
QuackQuackHonk is a programming language. It's purpose is to make code flexible. In QuackQuackHonk, functions, if statements, loops, and Python snippets are all variables. It is simpler than other programming languages yet it takes lots of code to build a simple program.
## Hello World
This is a simple Hello World program:
```
print:"Hello, world!"
```
## Data types
All programming languages have different datatypes â€” QuackQuackHonk has 8. The difference is that:

**QuackQuackHonk stores loops and if statements in variables so they can be used multiple times.**
## Commands
Most QuackQuackHonk code looks like this: <a/>
[command]:[token] <a/>

A token is an instance of a data type.

The only commands that don't follow this rule are PEMDAS operations.

I will not explain all of QuackQuackHonk in this file. There will soon be a QuackQuackHonk tutorial. If you know Python, then you can sure understand this programming language.
