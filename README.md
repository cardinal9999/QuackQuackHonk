# QuackQuackHonk
QuackQuackHonk is a programming language. It's purpose is to make code flexible. In QuackQuackHonk, functions, if statements, loops, and Python snippets are all variables. It is simpler than other programming languages yet it takes lots of code to build a simple program.
## Hello World
This is a simple Hello World program:
```
print:"Hello, world!"
```
## Data types
All programming languages have different datatypes. Here are examples:<a/>
|Python|JSON|QQH|Example|<a/>
|int   |num |int|3<a/>
|str |string|text| "Hello"<a/>
|float|real |dub|1.56<a/>
|bool|boolean|atom| true<a/>
|None  |null |ghost| null<a/>
|variable|---|mystery| 34;25;<a/>

I will not explain all of QuackQuackHonk in this file. There will soon be a QuackQuackHonk tutorial. If you know Python, then you can sure understand this programming language.
